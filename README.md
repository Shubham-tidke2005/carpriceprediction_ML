🚗 Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars based on various features such as car model, year, fuel type, transmission, and more. The dataset contains real-world data of cars including parameters like present price, kilometers driven, and ownership details.
By applying different machine learning algorithms and comparing their performance, the model identifies which algorithm gives the minimum error and best accuracy for price prediction.


🧠 Tech Stack & Libraries Used Python
Pandas – for data cleaning and analysis
NumPy – for numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization
Scikit-learn (sklearn) – for model building, encoding, scaling, and evaluation


⚙️ Key Concepts Implemented
Data Cleaning: Handling missing and inconsistent data
Label Encoding: Converting categorical variables (like Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission) into numerical format
Feature Scaling: Normalizing numerical values for better model performance

Model Training: Applied multiple supervised learning models such as
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Lasso/Ridge Regression

Model Evaluation:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
